# hello-world
My first repository - this is the beginning.

Hello, my name is Barry. I am beginning my journey in learning to code formally. I recently signed up for some classes, transitioning from years of self-study.

I am looking foward to grwoing in my skillset and hope to find a space in the cybersecurity world in the future.
